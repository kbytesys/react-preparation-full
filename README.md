## What you have to do
You can use any style/css library you want, but if possible use StyledComponents for your own css.

Don't use a component library, you must create every component you need (also simple components like buttons).

Application: 
- Create a basic application that uses this rest api https://gorest.co.in/
- List and open the detail of users, posts and comments
- Create unit tests (100% coverage)
- For each component created, create also a storybook story
- Integrate this graphql api: https://studio.apollographql.com/public/SpaceX-pxxbxen/home?variant=current
